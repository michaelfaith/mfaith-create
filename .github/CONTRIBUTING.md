## Code of Conduct

This project has a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) all contributors are expected to follow.

## Reporting Issues

Please do [report an issue](https://github.com/michaelfaith/eslint-plugin-package-json/issues/new/choose) if there are any bugs, documentation improvements, or general enhancements you'd like to see in the repository!
Please fully fill out all required fields in the most appropriate issue form.

## Contributing Code

Sending your own changes as a contribution is always appreciated!
There are two steps involved:

1. [Finding an Issue](#finding-an-issue)
2. [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)

### Finding an Issue

With the exception of very small typos, all changes to this repository generally need to correspond to an [unassigned open issue marked as `status: accepting prs`](https://github.com/michaelfaith/eslint-plugin-package-json/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22status%3A+accepting+prs%22+no%3Aassignee+).
If this is your first time contributing, consider searching for [unassigned issues that also have the `good first issue` label](https://github.com/michaelfaith/eslint-plugin-package-json/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22status%3A+accepting+prs%22+no%3Aassignee+).
If the issue you'd like to address hasn't been logged yet, see [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues) for filing your own (please do!).

### Sending a Pull Request

Once you've identified an open issue accepting PRs that doesn't yet have a PR sent, you're free to send a pull request.
Be sure to fill out the pull request template's requested information -- otherwise your PR will likely be closed.

PRs are also expected to have a title that adheres to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) format.
Only PR titles need to be in that format, not individual commits.
Don't worry if you get this wrong: you can always change the PR title after sending it.
Check [previously merged PRs](https://github.com/michaelfaith/eslint-plugin-package-json/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Adependencies+) for reference.

#### Draft PRs

If you don't think your PR is ready for review, [set it as a draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft).
Draft PRs won't be reviewed.
Once the PR is ready for us to review, mark it as ready.

#### Granular PRs

Please keep pull requests single-purpose.
In other words, don't attempt to solve multiple unrelated problems in one pull request.
Multi-purpose pull requests are harder and slower to review, block all changes from being merged until the whole pull request is reviewed, and are difficult to name well with semantic PR titles.
We also want to ensure each meaningful change has its own entry in our changelog.

#### Pull Request Reviews

When a PR is not in draft, it's considered ready for review.
Please don't manually `@` tag anybody to request a review.
A maintainer will look at it when they're able to.

#### Asking Questions

If you need help and / or have a question, posting a comment in the PR is a great way to do so.
There's no need to tag anybody individually.
One of us will drop by and help when we can.

Please post comments as [line comments](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) when possible, so that they can be threaded.
You can [resolve conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations) on your own when you feel they're resolved - no need to comment explicitly or wait for a maintainer.

#### Requested Changes

After a maintainer reviews your PR, they may request changes on it.
Once you've made those changes, [re-request review on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review).

Please try not to force-push commits to PRs that have already been reviewed.
Doing so makes it harder to review the changes.
We squash merge all commits so there's no need to try to preserve Git history within a PR branch.

Once you've addressed all our feedback, [re-request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review) from each maintainer whose feedback you addressed.

Once all feedback is addressed and the PR is approved, we'll ensure the branch is up to date with `main` and merge it for you.

#### Post-Merge Recognition

Once your PR is merged, if you haven't yet been added to the [_Contributors_ table in the README.md](../README.md#contributors) for its [type of contribution](https://allcontributors.org/en/emoji-key/ "Allcontributors emoji key"), you should be soon.
Please do ping the maintainer who merged your PR if that doesn't happen within 24 hours - it was likely an oversight on our end!
